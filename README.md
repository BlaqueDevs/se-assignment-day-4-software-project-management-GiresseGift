 Go over budget üí∏
 Take too long ‚è≥
* giving each and everyone who you managing a time slot deadline to complete the task that you have given them 

 
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

* The money that was used it made a succesful project and the cost were less contributing a huge succes to the projects due to the funds used properly
* - Resource Management: Efficient use of resources.
 - Risk Management: Identifies and mitigates risks.
 - Initiation:

- Define project goals and objectives.

- Conduct feasibility studies.

- Identify stakeholders.

- Develop project charter.

 Planning:

- Develop project management plan.

- Define scope, schedule, and budget.

- Plan resources, communication, and risk
management.

 Execution:

- Assign tasks to team members.

- Manage teams and communication.

- Ensure quality assurance processes are followed.
- 
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

 *Agile:

Description:

- Iterative and incremental approach to project
management and software development.

- Emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer
feedback.

Advantages:

- Quick response to changes.

- Regular customer feedback.

- Improved team collaboration.

Disadvantages:

- Less predictability.

- Requires significant customer involvement.

 * Waterfall:

Description:

- Linear and sequential approach.

- Each phase must be completed before the next begins.

Advantages:

- Clear structure and documentation.

- Easy to manage due to its rigidity.

Disadvantages:

- Difficult to accommodate changes.

- Testing occurs late in the process.
  
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

 * Agile can be more beneficial on a tech company wanting to launch because people can talk about the pros and the cons of the project
 * Waterfall can be more beneficial on hospital project because they can focus on one problem/projects after that one is done they can move to the next task.
   
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

 *Quality Assurance (QA):

- Process-oriented approach.

- Focuses on preventing defects.

Quality Control (QC):

- Product-oriented approach.

- Focuses on identifying defects in the final
product.
 * because of the disadvantage it may cause if the quality assurance is not implemented in the project
   
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

 * - Define project boundaries.
   - List deliverables and objectives.
   - Create Work Breakdown Structure
(WBS).
 *A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a hierarchical list of tasks that define a project's scope and deliverables. It's a tool used to plan, organize, and manage a project. 
Benefits of a WBS Helps define and organize work, Helps estimate costs and duration, Helps identify dependencies, Helps visualize projects, and Helps make projects more manageable and quantifiable. 
How to create a WBS 
Define the project's objectives
Identify the project's high-level phases
Brainstorm all activities and tasks
Structure your WBS
Review and refine the WBS
WBS components 
Work packages: Groups of related tasks that can be assigned to a team member or department
Control accounts: Used to group work packages and measure their status
Project deliverables: The desired outcome of project tasks and work packages

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

 * Develop a detailed timeline with
milestones.

- Use Gantt charts and timelines.
- Gantt chart because it will show them the duration of each task in time to be submitted
- 
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

*  To help the road stay safe because there is a lot of accident happening
*  because the audiences can benefit by reaching their homes safe
  
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

 * Because audiences on the road can report that a particualr truck
   
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
* perfect people can rely on it when facing a threating situation
  
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
* scan, identify the comapny and assist with road situations
  
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?

* at the moment none because it is stll developing
  
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software‚Äôs positioning and development?

* it can help because the latest things that are in can be implemented on my software‚Äôs positioning and development
